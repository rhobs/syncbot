        ## Description
        This pull request updates `jsonnet/versions.yaml` to match with the **already in use** downstream versions of the monitoring components.

        Based on that file, it regenerates the assets to update some metadata (mainly the `app.kubernetes.io/version` annotation) attached to some of the resources and update other placeholders.

        **It is safe to merge this change (provided that the CI jobs pass).**

        If you wish to perform this manually, execute the following commands from cluster-monitoring-operator repository:
        ```
        make versions
        make generate
        ```
